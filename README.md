# Raga-recognition

This work compares the performance of four deep learning model architectures trained on different psychoacoustic features for the task of raga recognition in Carnatic music. We used the Carnatic Music Raga Recognition Dataset (CMD) of the CompMusic Corpora, which can be found here: https://compmusic.upf.edu/corpora
